        A legacy wallet detected. Graffity switched to cloud wallets to be more
        welcoming to new nanocomers. It's easier to switch device and not lose account 
        and so on. <br/> <br/>
  
        You can choose to send the funds to your cloud wallet by clicking sync funds. 
        This will destroy your local wallet after the funds are sent, you can back it up now with the info 
        down the if you want to. <br/> <br/>
  
        If you don't care about this you can just remove the legacy wallet by
        clicking I don't care. This will also destroy your local wallet.
